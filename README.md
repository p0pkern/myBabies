# My Babies

Mother Beaver's babies are on the loose. Make sure to get them back in the shelter before they get hurt.

### Current update.
-  The baby beavers do wander and get pushed around somewhat properly.

### Future Update
- Need to add rotation animation
- Need to add score board for getting babies back in the nest
- Need to add dangerous animal/drowning
- Need to add emotion bubbles (it will make sense when implemented)
